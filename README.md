## My process

Small challenge and fairly easy one,i used flexbox for the layout and for the ratings. these ratings are clickable elements that only one of them can be selected and this it been done using JS. Once the user click on one of the ratings,its value will be stored on the session storage which is temporary BTW, So if the user submits his rating, its value will be used in the 'Thank you' card to show his rating to him.If the user didn't pick any rating he will get an alert message telling him to submit a rating.

### What I learned
i found some minor difficulties dealing with the button when it is clicked, so i learned about the importance of setting the type of the button also about the styling of it in the focus state.
